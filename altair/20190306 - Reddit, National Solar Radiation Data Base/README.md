This month's data viz challenge is on the TMY3 data set, which is the 3rd version of a data set containing hourly values of solar radiation and meteorological elements for a typical meteorogical year (TMY) for 1020 locations in the USA. For each location, the TMY was computed using a modified version of the Sandia method. The Sandia method selects individual, "most-typical" months from all the years of data available for the location; this is why the year for a typical January may vary from the year for a typical February. While TMY3 contains many data fields for modeling purposes, the primary metric used to calculate "typical-ness" is global radiation, so this is the only metric I chose to visualize.
